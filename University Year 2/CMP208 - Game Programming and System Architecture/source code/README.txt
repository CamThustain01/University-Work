///READ ME////

Within the source code I have included the scene_app .h & .cpp as thats where i update my state class and initialise it.
However, there is lots of code within these two sources that have no use or should have no use towards my application. I tried to either remove or comment out,
but this started causing some strange link errors that restarting the program couldnt fix so I had to no other decision but to keep them in.
