""SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?"""
"Jessie
""What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?"""
"Biggs
""Hold it, Jessie. He WAS in SOLDIER."""
"He quit them and now is one of us."

""Didn't catch your name..."""

""...Cloud."""

""Geez, we're really gonna blow
this huge furnace up?
This'll be somethin' to see!"""

"Barret
""Yo! This your first time in a reactor?"""
"Cloud
""No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know."""
"Barret
""The planet's full of Mako energy.
People here use it every day."""

"Barret
""It's the life blood of this planet.
But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out
with these weird machines."""
"Cloud
""I'm not here for a lecture.
Let's just hurry."""

"Barret
""That's it! You're comin' with me
from now on."""

"Jessie
""Biggs and I got the code for this door."""
"Biggs
""Code deciphered"""
"Biggs
""Think how many of our people risked their
lives, just for this code..."""
"Jessie
""Push that button over there!"""
Switch On.

"Barret
""Little by little the reactors'll drain out
all the life.
And that'll be that."""
"Cloud
""It's not my problem."""
"Barret
""The planet's dyin', Cloud!"""
"Cloud
""The only thing I care about is finishin' this job
before security and the Roboguards come."""

"Jessie
""Push the [OK] button in front of a ladder
to grab on to it.
After that, use the [Directional button]
to move up and down."""

"Barret
""When we blow this place, this ain't gonna
be nothin' more than a hunka junk."""
"Barret
""Cloud, you set the bomb."""
"Cloud
""Shouldn't you do it?"""
"Barret
""Jus' do it!
I gotta watch to make sure
you don't pull nothin'."""
"Cloud
""Fine, be my guest."""
Watch out!
This isn't just a reactor!!
"Barret
""......What's wrong?"""
"Cloud
""Huh?"""
"Barret
""What's wrong, Cloud?
Hurry it up!"""
"Cloud
""...Yeah, sorry."""
"Barret
""Heads up, here they come!"""

Cloud "Barret, be careful!"
"Attack while it's tail's up!
It's gonna counterattack with its laser."

Cloud "It's gonna fire that laser..."
"Attack while it's tail's up!
It's gonna counterattack with its laser."

Barret "I dunno what's goin' on, but...
it looks pretty bad.
Let's see what it does when it's tail's up..."

"Cloud
""Come on, let's get outta here!"""
Ten minutes to detonation!

"Cloud
""You all right?"""
"Jessie
""My leg got stuck."""
"Jessie
""Thanks!"""

"Biggs
""That should keep the planet going...
at least a little longer."""
"Wedge
""Yeah."""
"Barret
""........."""
"Jessie
""OK!
Now everyone get back."""
"Barret
""All right, now let's get out of here."""

""Rendezvous at Sector 8 station!
Split up and get on the train!"""

""If it's about your money
Save it 'til we're back at the hideout."""

"""Please!!
You're bothering the other passengers."""

that's pretty harsh, Cloud."

""Hey, Cloud.
You want to look at this with me?"""
"""It's a map of the Midgar Rail System.
Let's look at it together.
I'll explain it to you."""

Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement.
Now let me figure this out."""
"""Oh stop it, Cloud!
Did you hear me?"""

"Wedge
""......Cloud."""
"""You say you don't care,
but you came to talk to me."""
"""Cloud...
You just want friends."""
"""Isn't that right?""
          Blow off
          I really don't care"
"(1) ""Yeah, well.
You look kind of lonely to me."""
"""If you ever got anything you want to
get off your chest,
you can always talk to me."""
"(2) ""You're terrible.
Real cold blooded."""

"Tifa
""Listen, Cloud. I'm asking you.
Please join us."""
"Cloud
""Sorry Tifa..."""
"Tifa
""The Planet is dying.
Slowly but surely it's dying."""
"Someone has to do something."
"Cloud
""So let Barret and his buddies
do something about it."""
"It's got nothin' to do with me."
"Tifa
""So!
You're really leaving!?"""
"Tifa
""You're just going to walk right out
ignoring your childhood friend!?"""
"Cloud
""What......?""
          How can you say that!
          ......Sorry"
"(1+2) Tifa
""......You forgot the promise, too."""
"Cloud
""Promise?"""
"Tifa
""So you DID forget."""
"Tifa
""Remember......Cloud.
It was seven years ago..."""
"Tifa
""Look, the well."""
"Do you remember?"
"Cloud
""Yeah...back then."""
"Cloud
""I thought you would never come, and
I was getting a little cold."""
"Tifa
""Sorry I'm late."""
"Tifa
""You said you wanted to
talk to me about something?"""
"Cloud
""Come this spring...I'm leaving this
town for Midgar."""
"Tifa
""...All boys are leaving our town."""
"Cloud
""But I'm different from all of them.
I'm not just going to find a job."""
"Cloud
""I want to join SOLDIER."""
"Cloud
""I'm going to be the best there is,
just like Sephiroth!"""
"Tifa
""Sephiroth...
The Great Sephiroth."""
"Tifa
""Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?"""
"Cloud
""...I probably won't be able to come
back to this town for a while."""
"Cloud
""...huh?"""
"Tifa
""Will you be in the newspapers if you do well?"""
"Cloud
""I'll try."""
"Tifa
""Hey, why don't we make a promise?"""
"Tifa
""Umm, if you get really famous and
I'm ever in a bind......"""
"You come save me, all right?"
"Cloud
""What?"""
"Tifa
""Whenever I'm in trouble, my hero will
come and rescue me."""
"I want to at least experience that once."
"Cloud
""What?"""
"Tifa
""Come on--!
Promise me----!"""
"Cloud
""All right......I promise."""
"Tifa
""You remember now, don't you...
our promise?"""
"Cloud
""I'm not a hero and I'm not famous.
I can't keep......the promise."""
"Tifa
""But you got your childhood dream, didn't you?
You joined SOLDIER."""
"Tifa
""So come on!
You've got to keep your promise......"""
"Barret
""Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!"""
"Barret
""A promise is a promise!
Here!!"""
Received Barret's stash, 1500 gil!
"Cloud
""This is my pay?
Don't make me laugh."""
"Tifa
""What? Then you'll...!!"""
"Cloud
""You got the next mission lined up?
I'll do it for 3000."""
"Barret
""What......!?"""
"Tifa
""It's ok, it's ok."""
"Tifa
""psst, psst......
( We're really hurting for help, right? )"""
"Barret
""Uh......ugh......
( That money's for Marlene's schoolin'...... )"""
"Barret
""2000!"""
"Tifa
""Thanks, Cloud."""

"Tifa
""Good Morning! Cloud!"""
"""Did you sleep well?""
          Barret's snoring kept me up......
          Next to you, who wouldn't?"
"(1) Tifa
""psstpsst..."""
"""( keep it down, they'll hear you.
Barret's always edgy
before an operation. )"""
"(2) Tifa
""I don't know what you mean."""
"(end) Tifa
""I'm going this time."""

"Barret
""Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor.
Head for the station first."""
"I'll fill you in on the train."
"Barret
""Yo! Cloud!"""
"""Before the next mission,
I got somethin' I wanna ask you!"""
"""I, uh, ......
I don't really know how to use Materia!"""
"""I'll give you that Materia you found.
Just teach me how to use it!"""
"Cloud
""...sigh...""
          Ok, I'll explain it
          You wouldn't understand"
(1) Sure, I'll explain how Materia works.
First, access the menu.
You know the basic functions.
The triangle button brings up the menu.
Directional buttons move the cursor,
like this.
Select each menu by using the OK button.
If you want to leave the menu,
just push the CANCEL button.
See? Let's go ahead.
Now you're in this menu.
Select [Materia] sub menu.
Select who you want to use it.
Now look at my weapon here.
Each weapon and armor has slots in it.
Choose which slot you want to put Materia in.
Now select the Materia you want to use.
This is curative Materia.
If you want to know what its effect is,
line the cursor up with [Check],
and push the OK button.
It's just like selecting battle commands.
Just line the cursor up to [Magic],
you can see that the available magic has increased.
Now you can use new magic [Cure].
And that's all there is to equipping Materia.
See? It wasn't that tough!
When you want to remove any Materia,
it's as easy as pointing to the materia slot,
and pushing the triangle button.
There's just one thing you have to be careful of.
Whenever you equip Materia,
your situation changes.
Parts of you may become stronger...
while others get weaker.
Normally, when you equip [Magic] Materia,
your magic power will get stronger.
But your physical strength weakens.
So, Materia's kind of a double-edged sword.
On the left side of the screen,
you can see the Materia's effect on you.
It's wise not to overuse Magic Materia.
But try out various things.
Push the CANCEL button to exit the sub menu.
Ok, that's about it.
I'll give you some advanced tips later.
"Barret
""Shi......! What's this
'It wasn't that tough!' crap!"""
"I'm clueless......"
"Well, you handle the Materia then!"
"(2) Barret
""So this is what makes them guys
in SOLDIER so great, huh!?"""
"""Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later.
But you're in charge of the Materia!"""
"(end) Tifa
""Cloud! I got a message
from the Weapon Shop man upstairs."""
"""He has something he wants to give you.
Don't forget!"""
"Tifa
""Marlene,
you watch the store while we're gone!"""
"Marlene
""All right!!
Good Luck."""

"I hope he doesn't get hurt."
"That worries me the most."

"""Yesterday, everyone in town was
peeking at the two of you
from outside the bar."""
"""Tifa's childhood friend.
That's a good one!"""

"""Ahh!
Now I ain't got no one to pick on!"""

"Johnny
""I'm leaving. Goin' faraway.
But when I come back"
I'll be a better man! This is goodbye!"
"""Hey! Childhood friend!
You better take
good care of Tifa!"""

"""He used to give us nothing but headaches
when he was here,
but now that he's gone...I kind of miss him."""
"......strange, isn't it?"

"""Ha! Ha! ......
I wonder if my son's already left?"""
"""When it's just my wife and I here,
you have no idea how lonesome it gets."""
"""You want them to be happy
and do what they want while they're young,
but being a parent, you can't help but worry..."""
"I guess I'm not cut out to be a parent yet."
"By the way......"
"Where are you from?"
"
          A village called Nibelheim
          Who cares?"
"(1) ""Hm......you said Nibelheim?
Wasn't it in the news a while back?"""
"Something to do with a Reactor accident..."
"""That was the first major Mako accident,
so I remember it really being a hot topic."""
"(2) ""Ha, Ha! ...... Well,
there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say."""
"""But if you still have a family,
You outta at least write them."""
"""Even though you may turn your back
on your hometown,
It'll always be there for you."""
"Least that's how I see it."
"(end) ""Well,
you mind leaving the two of us alone?"""
"""I want to enjoy some quiet time
together with my wife."""

"""Ah...Johnny's gone.
You look a little disappointed."""
"""I don't like to say it myself but,
I'm just a lonely guy
when I'm not drinking."""

"""Listen!
If there isn't anyone to listen,
what's the use of"
getting gossip on everyone!?"
"Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!"
"""I'll get a little more information that would
poque even your interest.
You wait and see!"""

"""When it comes down to it...I'm gutless.
I'm still just a no good kid."""

"""Heh heh...He'll forget about it.
OH, you!!"""
"""Get my friend on the second floor
to teach ya."""

"This is the Beginner's Hall."

this is, don't you?"""

it'll cause too much commotion."""

go in alone... Oh, man......"""

""First...we need to find out
if Tifa's alright..."""

time. Will that be all right?"""
"Aeris
""What's the problem?"""
"""Well, my father, the owner,
has been in a slump lately.
You see, he makes all the dresses."""
"Aeris
""And, where is your father?"""
"""He's probably plastered
at the bar."""
"Aeris
""So...
You're saying we can't get a dress
unless we do something
about your father?"""
"""Yes, I'm sorry.
He's caused so much trouble."""

Please help my crazy old dad.

anything right now."""

you wait over there for a second.
I'll try and talk to him."""

and have something to drink."""
"Aeris
""You know, Mister."""

a cute dress for him..."""
"""What!?
A tough lookin guy like that?"""

""So, how 'bout it?
Will you make him one?"""
"""...might be interesting.
I was gettin' a little bored
just makin' regular clothes."""

""Then you'll do it for us?"""
"""Yeah, all right.
What kind of dress you want?"""
"Aeris
""Something...""
          That feels clean

Y'know I got a friend
that has the same taste as him.
I'll go talk to him."""

Wait till I get an image in my head.
Gulp...ummm, that's good."""

"""Looks like everything went well.
He's been making the dress
ever since he came back."""

Go try it on."""
"Cloud
""How......do you put this on?"""
"Cloud
""Whoa! What are you doing!"""
"Aeris
""It's still not right.
A wig! That's what you need!"""
"""Umm, I thought you might,
so I talked to my friend
about getting one."""
"""You know the gym?
You'll find a lot of people
there like you.
Go and talk to them."""

""...'like you'?
Aeris,
what did you tell him?"""
"Aeris
""Does it matter?
Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!"""
"""So?
Were you able to get the wig?"""
"""So, how was it?
Were you able to see him?"""

"""You the one......
Who wants to be cute?"""
"Cloud
""Cute?"""
"Aeris
""Right."""
"And about the wig..."
"""Yeah, I heard.
But it'll cost ya."""
"Urrrrgh!!!"
"""Big Bro!! The only way
you're gonna get cuter is
if you can beat Big Bro!!"""
"That's right!"
"""So, you've got to
compete with us!"""
"""You're right.
Let's do squats."""

We'll beat you
out of this gym!"""

""How are the preparations going?"""
"Heidegger
""Ha, ha, ha!! Smoothly, very smoothly!
I assigned the Turks to this."""

""President!!
Are we really going to do this?
Simply destroy a group
with only a few members..."""
"President Shinra
""What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?"""
"Reeve
""...No."""
"""But, as head of the Urban Development
Department,
I have been involved in the building
and running of Midgar. That's why..."""
"Heidegger
""Reeve, you should flush those personal
problems in the morning!"""

""The Mayor's against this anyway..."""
"Heidegger
""Mayor?"""
"""He just sits in this building all day
feeding his face!
You still call that a Mayor?"""
"Heidegger
""Now if you'll excuse me sir!"""
"President Shinra
""You're tired.
Why don't you take a couple of days
off and go somewhere."""
"President Shinra
""We'll destroy Sector 7

""Yeah."""

Marlene...Barret

""Don't give up, never give up hope.
It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?"""

"".........Yeah......you're right!
We still have time."""

"Let's try and jump down
Let's not......"

""Aeris.
I got you mixed up in all of this..."""

the trains that are lit up,
we should be able to get out of here."""

Reno "Try and break it if you can."
Reno "It's time."

"Tifa
""Cloud!
I don't know how to stop this.
Try it!"""

""You're going to help Aeris?"""
"Cloud
""Yeah...
But before that,
there's something I want to know."""
"Tifa
""What's that?"""
"Cloud
""...it's about the Ancients."""
"In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients.
I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!"
"Cloud
""Sephiroth...?"""
"Tifa
""Are you all right?"""
"Barret
""Pull it together, man!"""

"""Even with all that commotion,
you went on like nothing happened.
You must really been through the mill

that falls down here...what's next?"""

But, even so, where could we
move to now...?"""

"""Never thought that would
come tumbling down.
Maybe I better walk around
looking up from now on."""

"""...sure is loud outside.
Wonder what's happening?"""

"""You never know what's going to happen!
It's a crazy world,"""
"""so you'd better at least have a weapon
you can depend on! Am I right or what?"""

"""Living in a place like this,

some money and then scramble out of here!"""

for gil here.
No matter what."""

this time, however, according to some

do with the terrorist activities

a big time dealer on Wall Market."""

""...Sorry.
The Shinra have her."""

""I know.
They took her from here."""
"Cloud
""They were here?"""

""That's what Aeris wanted..."""
"Cloud
""Why is Shinra after Aeris?"""
"Elmyra
""Aeris is an Ancient.
The sole survivor."""
"Barret
""...What did you say?
But, aren't you her mother?"""
"Elmyra
""...Not her real mother.
Oh...it must have been 15 years ago..."""
"Elmyra
""...during the war.
My husband was sent to the front.
Some far away place called Wutai."""
"""One day, I went to the station because
I got a letter saying
he was coming home on leave."""
My husband never came back.
I wonder if something happened to him?
No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled.
I went to the station everyday.
Then, one day......
"You used to see this sort of thing
a lot during the war."
"Her last words were,
""Please take Aeris
somewhere safe."""
"My husband never came back.
I had no child. I was probably lonely.
So I decided to take her home with me."
"""Aeris and I became close very
quickly. That child loved to talk.
She used to talk to me about everything."""
"""She told me she escaped from some kind of
research laboratory somewhere. And that her
mother had already returned to the planet,
so she wasn't lonely...and many other things."""
"Barret
""Returned to the planet?"""
"Elmyra
""I didn't know what she meant.
I asked if she meant a star in the sky,"""
"""But she said it was this planet...
She was a mysterious child in many ways."""
"Aeris
""Mom."""
"Aeris
""Please don't cry."""
"Elmyra
""Aeris just blurted that out
all of a sudden. When I asked
her if something happened..."""
"Aeris
""Someone dear to you has just died."""
"""His spirit was coming to see you,
but he already returned to the planet."""
"Elmyra
""At that time I didn't believe her."""

""Several days later...
We received a notice
saying my husband died..."""
"Elmyra
""...and that's how it was."""
"""A lot had happened, but we were happy.
Until one day..."""
"Tseng
""We want you to return Aeris
to us. We've been searching
for her for a long time."""
"Aeris
""No!
Never!"""
"Tseng
""Aeris, you're a very special child.
You are of special blood."""
"Your real mother was an 'Ancient'."
"Elmyra
""Of course I heard it.
That she was an 'Ancient'."""
"Tseng
""The Ancients will lead us to
a land of supreme happiness."""
"""Aeris will be able to bring
happiness to all those in the slums."""
"""That is why Shinra would like
Aeris's cooperation......"""
"Aeris
""He's wrong!
I'm not an Ancient!
I'm not!"""
"Tseng
""But Aeris, surely you hear
voices sometimes
when you're all alone?"""
"Aeris
""No, I don't!"""
"Elmyra
""But I knew.
I knew about her mysterious powers..."""
"""She tried so hard to hide it,
so I acted as though I never noticed."""
"Cloud
""It's amazing how she's avoided
the Shinra for all these years..."""
"Elmyra
""The Shinra needed her,
So I guess they wouldn't harm her."""
"Tifa
""But why now......"""
"Elmyra
""She brought a little girl
here with her."""
"""On the way here, Tseng found them.
She probably couldn't
get away fast enough."""
"""She decided to go to the Shinra in
exchange for the little girl's safety."""
"Cloud
""Must be Marlene."""
"Barret
""Marlene!!
Aeris was caught
because of Marlene!?"""
"Barret
""I'm sorry.
Marlene's my daughter.
I'm ...really...sorry..."""
"Elmyra
""You're her father!?
How in the world could you ever leave
a child alone like that!?"""
"Barret
""...please don't start with that.
I think about it all the time.
What would happen to Marlene, if I..."""
"Barret
""But you gotta understand somethin'...
...I don't got an answer.
I wanna be with Marlene...
But I gotta fight."""
"Barret
""'Cause if I don't...the planet's gonna die."""
"Barret
""So I'm gonna keep fightin'!"""
"Barret
""But, I'm worried 'bout Marlene.
I really just wanna be with her...always."""
"Barret
""See? I'm goin' in circles, now."""
"Elmyra
""...I think I understand what you're saying...
She's upstairs asleep,
Why don't you go and see her."""

"Tifa
""It's my fault...
I was the one who got
Aeris involved in this."""
"Elmyra
""Don't say that.
Aeris doesn't think that."""
"Tifa
""I feel so depressed."""

"Elmyra
""...sigh..."""

"Barret
""I'm so glad......
I'm so glad you're all right..."""
"Marlene
""Daddy, don't cry.
Your whiskers
hurt!"""

""Cloud!"""
"Barret
""You gonna go help Aeris, right?
She's done so much for me..."""
"Barret
""If it's the Shinra you're dealin'
with, I can't just sit here!
I'm comin', too!"""
"Marlene
""Guess what? Guess what?
Aeris was asking me
lots of questions."""
"""Like what kind of person Cloud is.

""I know."""

""Right now, I feel I have to
push myself to the limit."""

""If I stayed here...I'll go crazy."""
"Barret
""Sorry, but can you take care
of Marlene a bit longer?"""
"Elmyra
""Yes, I don't mind."""
"Barret
""This place is dangerous now.
You better go somewhere else."""
"Elmyra
""...You're right.
But promise me that you'll
come back to her.
Don't get yourself killed."""
"Tifa
""How do we get to the Shinra Building?"""
"Barret
""There ain't no train
that goes up there anymore..."""
"Tifa
""......"""
"Tifa
""Well, let's just go to Wall Market.
We might be able to find something there."""

""I mean it, come back to her.
Don't get yourself killed."""

""Daddy,
Tifa,"
"""Cloud!
Please bring Aeris back!"""

"""Hey, ya'll.
Please stay here!"""

"It came down from the sky."
"""But the old guy who likes tanks took
all of it away.
I wanted some too."""

"""I never believed that Sector 7
would ever come down."""

"""According to that guy with the tank,
if you're strong enough,
anyone can make it to the top plate."""
"""So, build your strength by having
a plate of our food."""

"""Phew, it's all dusty
ever since the sky came down.
I'll have to start over."""

"That was scary..."

"""You're dressed normal today.
If something else
interesting comes up,
let me in on it."""

"""Hey!!
It's you!!"""
"Sorry, but I already heard about you."
"""In addition to dressing like a woman,
it seems you like
to smash and grind things."""
"""We only let cultured customers in!
Got it? Then you'd better leave!"""

"""Is this pile of trash
getting bigger?"""
"Yes, I think so."
"""A lot of things came falling down
when the Sector 7 pillar fell."""
"""Right, right, you're right.
The owner of the Weapons Shop
scavenged all the stuff that came
falling down."""
"""Oh is that why?
He seems pretty suspicious
these days."""
"""Oh, you mean he went out to
the Plate cross section next
to the Don's Mansion, right?"""
"""Oh, you know!
I wonder what he's doing?"""
"""Yeah!
It gives me the chills."""

"""Wanna see somethin' awesome?
Follow me!"""

"So? How's it?"

"More strength."
"""I bet you could climb all the way
up to the upper plate
if you used that pipe."""

can tell you more about it."""

"""Scary, isn't it?
You just never know when the plate
might come crashing down."""
"""Yeah.
I'd like to climb up to the
plate if I could."""

""Hey! You're...not them...
you're..."""
"""Please, help me!""

the Don's orders! Help me!"""

Shinra guys forced themselves in
here saying things like 'information
leaked' and 'good for nothing'."""

They're here again...
I'm outta here! SEE ya"""

"""You goin' up to the plate?
You better have a Battery."""

""You're gonna sell me
something you just found?"""
"""Hey, you knew?

so it's all right."""

""Why do I need a battery to
climb up to the plate?"""
"""You'll find out when you get there.
How 'bout 100 Gil for each?"""

"Come again."

"""Everyone climbed up this wire.
Looks scary......Brrr."""

""Can we climb it?"""
"""Yeah.
It leads to the Upper World."""
"Barret
""Awright!
We'll climb this wire!"""
"Cloud
""There's no way we can do this.
You know how far it goes up?"""
"Barret
""There IS a way!
Look! What's that look like?"""
"Cloud
""Just a normal wire."""
"Barret
""Oh yeah? Well to me it looks
like a golden shiny wire of hope."""
"""You're right.
This is the only way
to save Aeris..."""

""Ok, that was a bad analogy,
but, Barret,
I understand how you feel."""
"Cloud
""Let's go!"""

"""Oh man!
This is horrible..."""
"""Hey, scary, huh?
Dad told me that
it's the Shinra's doing."""

"Cloud
""...maybe if I put a battery in..."""
"The propeller might work."
"Cloud
""I guess I'll just have to
believe the shopkeeper."""

"Cloud
""Need a battery here, too."""

"Cloud
""Looks like the only way is
to jump onto that bar."""
"""Should make it if I
jump before it comes too close.
( use OK button to jump )"""
"Cloud
""Jumped too soon..."""
"Cloud
""Jumped too late..."""

"Barret
""Hey, you oughta know
this building well."""
"Cloud
""...Not really,
now that I think about it,"""
"""This's the first time I've ever been
to the Headquarters."""

special and not easy to get to

took Aeris."""

""Wait a second!
You're not thinking of just going
right through the main entrance, are you?"""

I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and......"""

We've got to find another way..."""

different route!"""

You really gonna take these
stairs all the way up?"""

get to Aeris
to help her somehow."""

""Who are you guys?"""
"Cloud
""I'm Cloud,
former SOLDIER First Class!"""
"Barret
""I'm from AVALANCHE!"""
"Tifa
""Same here!"""
"Aeris
""...a flower girl from the slums."""
"Red XIII
""...a research specimen."""
"Rufus
""What a crew."""
"Rufus
""Well, I'm Rufus.
The President of Shinra, Inc."""
"Barret
""You only President, 'cause yer old man died!"""
"Rufus
""That's right. I'll let you hear my
new appointment speech."""
"Rufus
""...Old man tried to control the world
with money.
It seems to have been working."""
"Rufus
""The population thought that Shinra
would protect them."""
"Rufus
""Work at Shinra, get your pay.
If a terrorist attacks,
the Shinra army will help you."""
"It looks perfect on the outside."
"Rufus
""But, I do things differently."""
"""I'll control the world with fear.
It takes too much to do it like my old man."""
"Rufus
""A little fear will control
the minds of the common people.
There's no reason to waste
money on them."""

"Tifa
""He likes to make speeches
just like his father."""
"Cloud
""Get outta this building
with Aeris!"""
"Barret
""What?"""
"Cloud
""I'll explain later!
Barret! This is the real crisis
for the Planet!"""
"Barret
""The hell's that supposed to mean?"""
"Cloud
""I'll tell you later!
Just take my word for it now!
I'll go after I take care of him!"""
"Barret
""Awright, Cloud!"""
"Aeris
""Cloud...
I just thought of something."""
"Tifa
""...I'll wait for Cloud!
Everyone, get to the elevator!"""
"Aeris
""Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on.
We should check on our equipment."""

"Cloud and
Tifa's Materia...
          ( Remove )
          ( Leave it as is)"

"Rufus
""Why do you want to fight me?"""
"Cloud
""You seek the Promised Land
and Sephiroth."""
"Rufus
""Hm, exactly."""
"Rufus
""Mm? Did you know
that Sephiroth is an Ancient?"""
"Cloud
""...A lot has happened.
Anyway, I can't let either you or Sephiroth
have the Promised Land!"""
"Rufus
""I see.
I guess this means we won't become friends."""

Rufus "Heh, Heh, Heh..."
Rufus "Heh, Heh, Heh..."
Rufus "Heh... That's all for today..."

"Tifa
""Where's Rufus?"""
"Cloud
""I couldn't finish 'em.
Looks like this's gonna get complicated."""

"Barret
""I'll go on ahead!"""
"Barret
""*&^%(*...
surrounded, huh?"""
"""If I was alone this wouldn't be a thang but,
I gotta reputation to protect."""
"Aeris
""You all get out
while you can."""
"""It's not you they're after...
it's me."""
"Barret
""Yeah, well that ain't happenin'."""
"""You got caught up in this over Marlene.
Now, it's my turn to watch out for you!"""
"Barret
""Ok, playtime's over
for you jackasses..."""
"Aeris
""...thank you, Mr. Barret!"""
"Barret
""Who you callin' Mr. Barret?
That don't sound right!"""
"Red XIII
""Well then..."""
"""If you are through talking,
may I suggest that we think of
a way to get out of here."""
"Barret
""Huh? Oh, oh yeah...
You a cold man.
Just like someone else 'round here I know."""
"Red XIII
""Did you say something?"""
"Barret
""Notta thing.
So what're we gonna do?"""
"Tifa
""Barret!!"""
"Barret
""Tifa!
Where's Cloud?"""
"Tifa
""Everyone, over here!"""
"Barret
""Huh?
What's up?
Where's Cloud?"""
"Tifa
""I'll tell you later!
Hurry, Hurry!!"""

"Barret
""Well, what do we do now?"""
"Cloud
""Sephiroth is alive.
I ...I have to settle the score."""
"Barret
""And that'll save the Planet?"""
"Cloud
""...Seems like it."""
"Barret
""Awright, I'm going!"""
"Aeris
""I'll go too.
...I have things that I want to find out."""
"Cloud
""About the Ancients?"""
"Aeris
""......Many things."""
"Tifa
""I guess this's good bye, Midgar."""

"Red XIII
""I'm going back to my hometown.
I'll go with you as far as that."""

"Tifa
""...I guess this is the start of our journey..."""
"          You hate traveling?
          It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?"
"(1) Tifa
""...I don't know.
But, I don't have anywhere else to go.
So I guess it doesn't really matter whether
I like to travel or not."""
"(2) Tifa
""......Mmm.
But you know, it should be all right
if you keep your promise."""

"Aeris
""You know what?
This is the first time I've ever left Midgar..."""
"          Really? ...You worried?
          It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?"
"(1) Aeris
""A little, ...no, maybe a lot.
But I have my bodyguard, right?"""
"(2) Aeris
""I thought you'd say that!"""

"Barret
""We told Aeris's mom to go
somewhere safe, so Marlene should be
safe too."""
"          Yeah, she should be
          Hmm, I don't know"
"(1) Aeris
""She said she didn't want to stay
in Midgar anymore.
...Maybe it's for the best."""
"(2) Aeris
""Stop it, Cloud!
I'm worried too."""

"Cloud
""Then..."""
"          Let's stay here for a while
          Let's go!"
"Barret
""We need a group leader for our journey.
'Course only me could be the leader."""
"Tifa
""You think so...?"""
"Aeris
""It would have to be Cloud."""
"Barret
""^#$^%......awright.
Go Northeast to a town
called Kalm.
If something happens,
we'll meet up there."""
"Barret
""'Sides, we can't have 5 people
strolling down the fields.
It's too dangerous.
Split us into 2 parties..."""

"Barret
""Later, at Kalm!"""
"Tifa+B2884:B2898
""We'll see you at Kalm!"""
